# MNTN Assessment

## Public Api Info
For this excercise I have choosen a simple public api which takes in an ip address andd provides some info like from which city is the request being made, country etc

## What do tests do
I wrote few tests using pytest python framework verifying certain things that are mentioned in the docstrings of the test
 
## Running the tests
1. Pull git@github.com:avinashgtm/Assessment.git and cd to the directory
2. Install python packages with the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Execute the tests with the command : pytest --html=report.html

## Reading test report
After step 3 is executed successfully report.html should have been generated in the same directory, just open it in your browser it will show you what tests it ran
